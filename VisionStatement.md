#SynthsGW Vision Statement

Our software is for the amateur musician interested in creating custom synths
and beats in an interface which allows them to upload their own songs, edit
their songs, and incorporate the synths and beats to go along with their song.
This is for musicians who have some experience with gathering their music, but
our software allows users to categorize moments of music, too. It allows them
to organize these musical moments by length, key, genre, in a user defined way,
to make custom creation of new music easy and fun.

Unlike other synth and beat software, being able to quickly see portions of
songs is made easy. This way, amateur producers can quickly get the sound they
desire by taking advantage of the interface to organize these musical moments,
in a way that is definitive and easy. The softwareâ€™s GUI makes moving,
stitching, and cutting sections of music easy.
